## Description

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses and figures for:

Rogers, L.A., K.E. Axler, and J.S. Bigman. 2026. Widespread phenological shifts with temperature in Alaska's marine fishes. *Global Change Biology*.

This study analyzes over four decades of larval fish length data from the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea to investigate changes in phenology. Data were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, EcoFOCI Program.

Note that large model objects are saved offline. Larval length data files are available on Dryad.
